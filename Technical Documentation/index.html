        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements</p>
        <p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. </li>
        </p>

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. </p>
        <p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. </p>
        <p>JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
        <header>Global Variables</header>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
      </section>
       <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways. One, With the keyword var. For example,
           <code>var x = 42.</code>
           This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

            With the keyword let. For example,
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

           JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

           <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
           This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

           <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</p></code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declaration">
        <header>Function Declaration</header>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code></p>
        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.

        <code>return number * number;</code>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
